untgz - unzip like replacement plugin, except for gzipped tarballs
KJD <jeremyd@fdos.org>


HISTORY:
- 20030101  KJD  1.0.0
  initial release (used for AbiWord v2 as a replacement for spawning unzip.exe)
- 20030103  KJD  1.0.1
  modified to not require c runtime library and added version resource
  (note still links with crt for some oddball VC functions stkchk, chkesp, & allmul)
- 20030109  KJD  1.0.2
  implemented extract (include) and don't extract (exclude) list parsing
  cleaned up compile some (no longer needs to link with MSVCRT for some static functions
  added MS VC 6 project file (makefile generated from this)
  moved extraction from tar.gz code (mostly untgz.c from zlib anyway) into separate file from plugin
- 20030115  KJD  1.0.3
  fixed stack bug, rearranged options so doesn't read past called options
  placed utility functions into separate file (so easier for others to reuse if wanted)
  added example/test files
- 20030920  KJD  1.0.4
  correct Makefile.abi, adjust source so doesn't use intrinsic memcpy/memset functions
  even when /Oi (enable intrinsics) is given (e.g. via /O2)
- 20040408  KJD  1.0.5
  patch by Tavella Gaston to correctly return an error 'status' when we fail
  to extract from the tarball
  updated example.nsi to demonstrate errors and added truncated examplecorrupt.tgz
- 20041128  KJD  1.0.6
  a little late but anyway, handle zero (0) byte files in tarballs as requested by 
  Brian Smith (amusing as I went to a college with a different Brian Smith :-)
- 20041226  KJD  1.0.7
  removed potential issue where plugin 1st attempted to create file (to extract)
  then only if that failed junked any path stored in tarball then try again,
  it now only tries once after either junking path or attempting to create path.
  Added but not compiled in by default function to strip paths of leading root (\)
  or parent (..) references.
  Added mkdummyfiles.cpp, creates set of dummy files for testing purposes, see source.
  Added plgntester.cpp, can be used to run (test) plugins outside of an installer;
  see plgntester.txt for more information.
- 20041227  KJD  1.0.8
  changed to use NSIS' included zlib (more-or-less), reduced size in half
  added check to ensure header chksum appears valid
  treat type '7' (contiguous files) as regular files instead of ignoring
  moved plgntester to own archive
  add MSVC 7 project files
  *tested and appears to work, however due to changes, problems may still exist*
- 20050629  KJD  1.0.9
  bugfix, some tarballs would fail to inflate correctly causing extraction
  failure due to issue with used zlib, therefore updated to zlib 1.2.2 and
  no longer using NSIS' included zlib (unfortunately plugin size increased).
  changed -d option so sets working directory after opening tarball; note:
  this may require changes in your installer if you relied on tarball being
  in same directory as specified by -d instead of providing path to it;
  so current directory at time of call is used for tarball without path
  as expected.  Additionally, as -d will attempt to create path if it does
  not exist, this has been moved so only final -d path creation tried.
  Added experimental support for GNU tar long names (max 255 char limit).
- 20050702  KJD  1.0.10
  gzipped (.tgz) and uncompressed (.tar) TAR file handling unchanged.
  added initial support for other compression methods, must be specified manually.
  implemented support for LZMA compressed tarballs (.tar.lzma or possibly? .tlz)
- 20060327  KJD  1.0.11
  added projects files for VC8 (MS VC Express 2005 + MS Windows 2003R2 SDK),
  note this required predefining a few more defines to avoid inclusion of 
  MSVC8's clib and changing crc32.c to explicitly using unsigned long instead
  of a type based on limits.h (vc8's causes conflicts with included miniclib).
  To reduce plugin size by about 7KB one can recompile crc32.c with NOBYFOUR.
- 20061113  KJD  1.0.12-pre
  implemented KEEP (-k) and UPDATE (-u) options
  Warning: now aborts with error if fails to create/overwrite existing file,
  prior versions merely displayed a message indicating failure to extract
  and returned as though all files successfully extracted
  Updated to zlib 1.2.3
  Note: prerelease, should fully work but still need to test -k and -u options
  some more, possibly add option to continue by skipping file(s) on errors.
- 20061118  KJD  1.0.13
  Updated to lzma sdk 4.43
  integrated BZip2 (v1.0.3) support using miniclib
- 20071106  KJD  1.0.14
  Fix minor resource leak, missing FindClose call if -u and file skipped
  Releases now built with VC8 (MS VC Express 2005 + MS Windows Platform SDK)
  (prior releases built with MSVC6)
- 20071107  KJD  1.0.15
  Automatically determine compression type if not explicity indicated.
  Split README.TXT into multiple files to ease reading.
- 20091013  KJD  1.0.16
  Update untar.c to prepend prefix to name field if not empty for names > 100 chars.
  Released as an update to 1.0.15, but compiled with MSVC6.
- 20100115  KJD  1.0.17
  No functional changes for standard NSIS, same as 1.0.16.
  Added support for Unicode build of NSIS (use untgz.dll in unicode directory).
- 20100116  KJD  1.0.18
  Initial support for hard links.  Will issue a warning if a hard link is found
  and unable to create.  The option -h may be used to force failure if unable
  to create a hard link.  Only works on NT5 or higher on NTFS; will fail on all
  earlier versions of Windows, if file system is FAT or non NTFS, or if 
  accessing NTFS file system via a share (mapped drive).
